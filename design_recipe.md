## 1 problem - user story
```
As a member of a group chat,
I want the chat's participants shown as a single readable line,
so that I can see at a glance who's in the conversation.

Acceptance criteria:

No participants: the line is empty.
[] => ""

One participant: just their name.
["Bart"] => "Bart"

Two participants: joined with an ampersand.
["Bart", "Lisa"] => "Bart & Lisa"

Three or more participants: commas between names, with an ampersand before the last one.
["Bart", "Lisa", "Maggie"] => "Bart, Lisa & Maggie" 

Order is kept: names appear in the same order they were given.
```
